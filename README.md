## 🌟 Overview  

**DeepFinanceClassifier** is an advanced deep learning system tailored for **automatic categorization of financial documents**.  
It is designed to process raw financial statements, extract meaningful text, and classify them into distinct categories such as **Balance Sheet**, **Income Statement**, **Cash Flow Statement**, **Notes**, and **Miscellaneous Reports**.  

> ⚡ Unlike traditional rule-based approaches, DeepFinanceClassifier leverages **modern NLP + deep learning** to achieve **up to 96% accuracy** in classification.

## 🎯 Key Features  

- ✅ **High Accuracy Models** → Bi-LSTM & FinBERT-based Transformers  
- ✅ **Plug-and-Play** → Upload any financial document (HTML, PDF)  
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface** → Streamlit-based web app for real-time classification  
- ✅ **Cloud Ready** → Deployable on Hugging Face, AWS, or Google Cloud  
- ✅ **Explainable AI** → Integrated SHAP/LIME for transparency  
- ✅ **Batch Processing** → Classify multiple documents at once

## 🧠 Model Architectures  

### 🔹 Bi-LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- Efficient for sequential text data  
- Lightweight → suitable for **local use**  
- Accuracy ~ **92%**  

### 🔹 Transformer (FinBERT / RoBERTa Fine-Tuned)  
- Context-aware, financial-domain optimized  
- Captures **semantic nuances** in reports  
- Accuracy ~ **96.4%**, F1 ~ **0.964**
